2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Program_Counter/RegisterSelectA_reg[1]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) Instruction_Decoder_0/RegisterSelectA_reg[0]/CLR, Instruction_Decoder_0/RegisterSelectA_reg[1]/CLR, Instruction_Decoder_0/RegisterSelectB_reg[1]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin Program_Counter/MemorySelect_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin Program_Counter/MemorySelect_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin Program_Counter/MemorySelect_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Instruction_Decoder_0/RegisterSelectA_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Instruction_Decoder_0/RegisterSelectA_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Instruction_Decoder_0/RegisterSelectA_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Instruction_Decoder_0/RegisterSelectA_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Instruction_Decoder_0/RegisterSelectB_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Instruction_Decoder_0/RegisterSelectB_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Register_Bank/Reg_1/Q_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Register_Bank/Reg_1/Q_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Register_Bank/Reg_1/Q_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Register_Bank/Reg_1/Q_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Register_Bank/Reg_1/Q_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Register_Bank/Reg_1/Q_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Register_Bank/Reg_2/Q_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Register_Bank/Reg_2/Q_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#8 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Register_Bank/Reg_2/Q_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Register_Bank/Reg_2/Q_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#9 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Register_Bank/Reg_2/Q_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Register_Bank/Reg_2/Q_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
